# English-Dictionary-to-Code
Defining a non-circular dictionary in code in the Wolfram Mathematica.  Trying to break things down to Semantic Primes and maybe further.  This is a really really really rough version right now.  You can run and edit Mathematica code for free on the Wolfram Development Platform right now, but here is a version you can view right away: https://www.wolframcloud.com/objects/udqbpn/Published/Dni.nb.  I probably will translate it to Python or Haskell some time. You can run this for free on the Wolfram Cloud, or on a free Python version of Mathematica called Mathics, or a Haskell version you can find on Google.

Semantic Primes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_primes

A non-circular dictionary based on sematic primes that I am basing much of this off of: http://learnthesewordsfirst.com/
