# English-Dictionary-to-Code
Defining a non-circular dictionary in code in the Wolfram Language.  Trying to break things down to Semantic Primes and maybe further.  My code is a MESS right now and nowhere NEAR functional.  Just thought I'd share what I have though.  Working on it.  You can run and edit Mathematica code for free on the Wolfram Cloud.
